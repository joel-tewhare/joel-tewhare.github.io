      You can picture it, that crossroad you find yourself at all too often -
      one road that leads down an easy path towards a person you don't really
      enjoy being, and a second, harder path that leads you to act as the kind
      of person you want to be. The ethical choice is effing hard! Imagine
      you're hiring some extra help at work for Christmas and your team mate has
      told his daughter to apply. You end up hiring someone with more
      experience. This happened to me recently. I had decided to prioritize
      merit over personal ties. The job was lower-level with tasks most people
      would be able to pick up regardless of their prior experience (just some
      extra training needed). I'm still making arguments for both sides of this
      scenario to this day..

      For me, a high compliment is someone saying I remind them of a person I
      know or admire. It might be generosity like my dad, funny like my friend,
      business savvy like my boss - truth is, people rub off on us all the time
      and it's kinda nice to think about who you think has best shaped your
      identity and values so far (cue warm fuzzies). I learned the value of
      community early on with family, growing up in a small town. I think the
      kitchen table is one of the most important pieces of furniture in a home.
      It's where I've experienced community most vividly and is the place many
      of my values were cemented as a kid and continue as an adult - the
      importance of laughter, caring for visitors, accepting a challenging
      viewpoint, being willing to stand up for your own, making a decent cup of
      tea...as I said, the IMPORTANT stuff! More recently, I was influenced
      working nearly ten years on cruise ships. Working alongside thirty-plus
      nationalities on a vessel surrounded by water can be both challenging and
      rewarding. You learn a lot about people, everything from how their culture
      shapes their world view to how you both can curve your accents to
      understand one another. You learn the value of creating family when away
      from your own and most importantly, how to work hard, play hard.

      If I'm honest, I love a good quote. I can't help it, I grew up when the wave of self-help books and spirituality was at its gnarliest. A couple come to mind that help my approach to learning and highlight some of my strengths:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am a human being, nothing human can be alien to me" - if you accept this, then you can never look at someone's rude behaviour and say 'oh I'd never do that...". On the flip side, if someone does something great and seemingly impossible, you take comfort in the fact that you have everything in you, just as they do, to be able to achieve the same things. I try to keep a positive outlook like this which puts me in a helpful position to learn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Life is long, if you're lucky" - Essentially, don't sweat the small stuff. I keep a big picture view to get through the challenges of the day. Chances are you'll look back after a day, month, year and wonder what the fuss was all about. Be grateful for what you're problem-solving and learning today, tomorrow isn't a guarantee.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can have it all, you just can't have it all at once" - Have patience. Success requires all kinds of sacrifice with failure pretty much built into the process when you choose to dream big. I'm less shaken by making mistakes with this mindset and try my best to see success possible for anything you're willing to stick with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Waxing poetic about myself is good and all but knowing my strengths on paper and practicing them consistently does present a challenge some days. Sometimes you don't think you can achieve anything great. Sometimes you are sweating the small stuff. Sometimes you are impatient for success. There's outside influences that can hinder progress - a massive day at work before an evening of study, a busy household you're trying to study in the middle of, the blue sky of summer tempting you away from the computer screen to the fresh air. For career development, I do wonder how far I can go coming into a completely new learning environment at the bottom rung of the knowledge ladder. I'm hoping I don't stray too far into comparing myself to others who may have more experience or what seems to be a natural understanding of the course material.

      This is where having friends helps, but you've got to be willing to put in the work sometimes to establish good connections, particularly when surrounded by a new group of people. As a manager, nothing is more challenging than a struggling through a brainstorming session in silence. You're trying to be productive but no one wants to speak, contribute or even smile. I've overcome this situation by splitting people off into pairs and having them write ideas down which I then read out once the whole group reassembled. I've tried hosting a session first thing in the morning when I thought people were at their freshest. On occasion, I've just sat in the silence until someone can't stand it anymore and speaks (kinda funny and probably least effective). I have seen people successfully add an element of fun into what is perceived to be a rather boring activity. Things I'd try like adding a quiz at the top of the session, having music on for ten minutes in the background before starting a session, giving out chocolate to anyone who brings up secret keyword or phrase during the brainstorm. Just describing these things, I already feel more relaxed..
