      <p>
        If you're like me, you like to work smarter, not harder. Class and id
        declarations in HTML and CSS are two clever ways we can apply design to
        our web pages. When talking about 'design', this could mean a simple
        element change - a certain font size for text, a space of 'x' amount
        between paragraphs for example. Design also includes those elements that
        affect the way a user experiences your webpage or application - examples
        could be how sections change depending on the device they're using or
        the options created for navigating a page.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Imagine you're creating a new webpage for a business you're starting.
        Consider the following thoughts you might have below while coding:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>"I want these sections to fit a theme"</li>
        <li>"I love this color combination"</li>
        <li>"These blocks should all resize for a smaller screen"</li>
        <li>
          "There's gotta be an easier way to make these paragraphs look the
          same"
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you're saying some version of the examples above, you're likely
        looking to use a class declaration to achieve your design decisions.
        That is, you want to reuse or repeat style elements across your web
        design. That might be a single element or a group of elements that you
        think work well together or achieve a certain goal.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Consider some more questions your may ask yourself while working on HTML
        and CSS for your new business:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>"I wish I could change this without messing everything else up"</li>
        <li>"This needs to make a statement"</li>
        <li>"I'm not sure this title font will work anywhere else"</li>
        <li>"This button will be the only way to go back to the homepage"</li>
        <li>"My webpage looks good on everything but a mobile phone"</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If trying to problem solve any of the above examples, best practice
        would be to use an id declaration to achieve this - that is, you want to
        create a unique element style that won't be used elsewhere or you may
        need a certain group of attributes to take priority over others.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <strong
          >All class declarations begin with period followed by a unique name
          that summarizes in some way the style attribute/s you are wanting to
          set. We declare these inside the CSS stylesheet</strong
        >
      </p>
      <img
        id="home-image"
        src="../images/css-class-example.png"
        alt="class coding example in css file"
      />
      <p>
        <strong
          >Notice that if using multiple words, they are connected by dashes.
          Curly brackets both open and close around the attribute/s you want to
          apply. The unique class name then becomes the selector name we use
          inside the HTML file to refer to the styling we want to happen</strong
        >
      </p>
      <img
        id="home-image"
        src="../images/html-class-example.png"
        alt="class coding example in html file"
      />
      <p>
        <strong
          >Note we do not use the period inserting the class selector into the
          HTML file.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Id declarations follow exactly the same process as explained above
          except a hashtag replaces the use of a period at the start when
          creating a unique id name. The hashtag is also removed when referring
          to the id inside the HTML file.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <img
        id="home-image"
        src="../images/html-class-example.png"
        alt="class coding example in html file"
      />
      <img
        id="home-image"
        src="../images/html-class-example.png"
        alt="class coding example in html file"
      />
      <br />
      <p>
        Back to the point of working smarter not harder, class and id
        declarations should save you the time it would take to individually
        apply a set of attributes over and over to numerous tags. It is also a
        smarter way of organizing your code, where all the different settings
        for styling are outlined together in the CSS file, these are then only
        referred to in the HTML file, keeping both files well presented and
        tidy.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Other tips to remember:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Code is read by your device from top down, left to right so any
          conflict of classes, the one positioned further down the stylesheet
          will take priority or the first listed if sharing the same line,
          inside an open tag.
        </li>
        <li>
          Id declarations are always prioritized no matter their position in
          relation to other classes.
        </li>
      </ul>
