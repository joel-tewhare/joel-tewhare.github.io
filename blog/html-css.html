      <p>
        If you're like me, you like to work smarter, not harder. Classes and ids
        are two clever ways we can apply design to our web pages. When talking
        about 'design', this could mean a simple styling change - a certain font
        size, a margin of 'x' amount between paragraphs for example. We can also
        include in design, style elements that affect how a user
        <em>experiences</em> your webpage or application. Examples include: how
        sections may change depending on the screen dimensions or the way in
        which a user is able to navigate around a page.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Imagine you're creating a new website. Consider the thoughts below that
        you might have during the coding process:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>"I want these sections to have a theme"</li>
        <li>"I love this color combination"</li>
        <li>"These blocks should all be shorter for a smaller screen"</li>
        <li>
          "There's gotta be an easier way to make these paragraphs look the
          same"
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you're saying some version of the above to yourself, you're likely
        looking to use classes to achieve your design decisions. That is, you
        want to reuse or repeat style elements across your webpage. That could
        be a single element you're thinking about or a group of elements that
        you think work well together.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Let's consider some other thoughts that may come up while coding:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>"I wish I could change this without messing everything else up"</li>
        <li>"This needs to make a statement"</li>
        <li>"I'm not sure this title font will work anywhere else"</li>
        <li>"This button will be the only way to go back to the homepage"</li>
        <li>"My webpage looks good on everything but a mobile phone"</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When thinking of ways to problem solve any of the above examples, best
        practice would be to use an id. You want to create a unique style
        element that won't be used elsewhere or it could be a certain group of
        style attributes that you want to have priority.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <strong
          >All classes begin with period followed by a unique name that
          summarizes in some way the style attribute/s you are wanting to set.
          We declare these inside the CSS stylesheet</strong
        >
      </p>
      <img
        class="blog-image"
        src="../images/css-class-example-1.png"
        alt="class coding example in css file"
      />
      <p>
        <strong
          >Notice: if you're using multiple words for a class, they are
          connected by dashes. Curly brackets both open and close around the
          attribute/s you want to apply. The unique class name you've created
          now becomes the 'selector' name we use inside the HTML file to refer
          to the styling we want to happen</strong
        >
      </p>
      <img
        class="blog-image"
        src="../images/html-class-example-1.png"
        alt="class coding example in html file"
      />
      <p>
        <strong
          >Note: we do not use the period when stating the class selector in the
          HTML document</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Creating an id, we follow exactly the same process as outlined above
          except, a hashtag replaces the use of a period when creating a unique
          title for your id. The hashtag is also removed, like the period was,
          when being stated inside the HTML file</strong
        >
      </p>
      <img
        class="blog-image"
        src="../images/css-id-example-1.png"
        alt="class coding example in html file"
      />
      <img
        class="blog-image"
        src="../images/html-id-example-1.png"
        alt="class coding example in html file"
      />
      <br />
      <p>Also helpful to remember:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Code is read by your program from top down. If there are any conflicts
          between your classes, the one positioned further down the stylesheet
          will take priority.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ids are ALWAYS prioritized no matter their position in relation to
          other classes. The image below shows an example of what this might
          look like.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <img
        class="blog-image"
        src="../images/html-id-example-2.png"
        alt="class coding example in html file"
      />
      <br />
      <p>
        Back to the point of working smarter not harder - classes and ids should
        help save you the time it would take to individually apply a change or
        set of attributes over and over to numerous tags. They're also tools to
        easily apply these style choices to other parts of your project and make
        it more cohesive. It is also a smarter way of organizing your code, with
        all the different settings for styling outlined together in your CSS
        file. These are then only 'referred' to in the HTML file, keeping both
        sides well presented and tidy.
