      <h3>10 April 2025: Revisiting my learning plan ahead of Bootcamp</h3>
      <p>
        Heading into Bootcamp, the versatility you can bring being a Full Stack
        Developer still makes it an appealing career goal to me. While my
        interest leans more towards front-end concerns like how to create and
        design interfaces that are user-friendly, responsive, and visually
        appealing - I think having skills on the backend and valuable knowledge
        of what's going on 'behind the scenes' can inform the kind of front-end
        possibilities you're able to come up with for use in projects. I'm not
        sure I have a specific company or industry as a goal destination just
        yet but any way I can use software development to innovate I would find
        fulfilling.
      </p>
      <p>
        My learning strengths highlighted in my original plan all played a role
        during Foundations and will continue to be key to helping me succeed
        during Bootcamp. I would add to the list: an ability to research and
        reflect well. I've developed good methods for finding answers and then
        teaching them to myself again through notes and breaking down processes
        that lead to success.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thankfully, the limitations I noted in my original plan either haven't
        played out so far or haven't impacted my learning in a significant way
        up to this point. As we start to mix more with our cohort during
        Bootcamp, I'm hoping my work speed doesn't hinder progress (typing out
        code on the keyboard for example). There's more opportunity for us as
        students to be both learners and teachers as we work together and I hope
        I can be flexible with other's learning styles to try and best
        communicate to avoid facing too many hurdles.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd add one other limitation to consider: work/study commitment and
        motivation. I didn't fully appreciate the commitment of taking on full
        time work and study at the same time. For all the good planning you can
        do to make your schedule achievable, things come up, motivation can be
        down, you feel time-poor to be able to fit in other things you'd like to
        do. This highlights keeping up with the Bootcamp material as one of the
        non-technical challenges I see for myself. It seems like a step up from
        Foundations with less guided help from the curriculum.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other non technical challenge I've identified is imposter syndrome -
        even though I know we're all learning these new skills together, working
        with others more during Bootcamp, there's a chance you start comparing
        yourself more and possibly thinking you're ideas aren't as great as this
        person or I haven't learned as much as this person for example. This is
        where the Bootcamp team can be helpful.
      </p>
      <p>
        It terms of my expectations, they're much the same as throughout
        Foundations - facilitating regular check-ins (tech and human skills
        discussions), offering additional help outside of these check-ins and
        being reliable to turn to for helpful resources that might be useful for
        different assessments. From my side, after re-reading my commitment set
        out during Foundations, I would apply the same steps to Bootcamp. Having
        a planned schedule (I recently reviewed my weekly plan, tweaking it to
        feel better organized), being mindful when working with others and
        having methods for problem-solving through road blocks in the material,
        are all still important and detailed well in my original plan.
      </p>

      <h3>28 February 2025: Setting a plan during Foundations</h3>

      <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
      <p>
        Full stack developer. Long term I'd love opportunities to be involved
        with different industries and learn the role software plays in achieving
        their vision. I also admire small business. Down the road, I'd love to
        give back in some way by helping find software solutions that could help
        small businesses succeed.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>
        Give a description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
      </h3>
      <p>Learning strengths:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Happy dancing</strong>. I find problem-solving enjoyable.
          Nothing is better than celebrating after solving what is seemingly
          impossible at the time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>I love a list!</strong> I'm checklist-orientated and find it
          helps with breaking a bigger goal into short-term successes and lets
          you figure out what you need to prioritize.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>I'm a creative thinker</strong>. My work life so far has
          taught me the importance of being innovative. This can be in big and
          small ways but always lead by the same question: is there a way this
          could be done better?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Learning limitations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Oh flip!</strong> I've only had more 'traditional' learning
          experiences up until now and the flipped classroom approach has meant
          forming new habits, moving away from knowledge and answers towards
          thinking critically and seeking solutions. It'll be a journey but it's
          been rewarding so far!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The keyboard</strong>. Like, the literal keys. I'm not the
          quickest at typing out code, I don't know all the shortcuts. But we're
          getting there...slowly.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Self belief</strong>. I find my confidence in one thing is
          often dictated by what's going in the rest of my life - a not so great
          week at work means it might shake my self belief during study.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <h3>
        What non-technical/human skills would you like to see developed in
        yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Collaboration</strong>. In a day job where I have a management
        role, it can feel very singular at times. I'm excited to see what I can
        learn working with others without this dynamic at play and learning from
        those with more background in coding.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Building relationships</strong>. Having been in retail, customer
        service, entertainment industries in the past, I'm looking forward to
        being introduced to, and working with, a new cross-section of people and
        personalities.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Managing uncertainty</strong>. I do OK but want to push myself
        in this regard. In an industry that's forever evolving. I want to
        develop strategies for when I feel 'lost' in learning and better manage
        that feeling of "am I ever going to understand this"?
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Outline your commitment to managing your workload</h3>
      <p>
        I have scheduled my week to include twenty hours of study around work
        and other commitments. I have organized to have Saturdays 'free'. This
        provides a buffer and should anything unexpected come up, there is room
        to be flexible or add in some extra study time.
      </p>
      <p>
        When working with others, I value their time and respect that we are all
        showing up with different things going on in our personal lives. While
        the best way to converse, brainstorm ideas or execute the workload may
        differ among the group, what will be consistent is my level of respect,
        an eagerness to succeed and, importantly, my aim have a great time
        learning to code! Any moments that aren't feeling so great, my
        preference is to talk it through as soon as possible and try find a
        solution. I'll seek advice from people outside a situation when needed
        and if really bothersome, there is the facilitation team to reach out
        to. One-on-one conversations, the discord chat or messages are all tools
        available to use.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I've reached a difficult spot in learning, I will look to previous
        notes or to the internet for some additional resources. Following that,
        I will message my homegroup or the cohort at large to see if anyone else
        is feeling the heat too or has some guidance. If I haven't found a
        solution within 2-3 days, I will reach out to the facilitators.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>What do you expect from the Facilitation team?</h3>
      <p>
        Nothing that hasn't already been demonstrated: a set time to check-in
        regularly with our homegroup, options for conversations throughout the
        week if needed, care for how we're doing and how our lives are outside
        of studying. Moving towards the more intense parts of the course,
        thoughtful feedback, suggestions for moving forward and a positive
        figure to call on for guidance is what I will find most helpful.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>
        What other commitments do you need to consider during the course of your
        studies this year?
      </h3>
      <p>
        We are due to have a family reunion this year across Easter weekend.
        Apart from that, there aren't any commitments I haven't already
        accounted for. I usually work Sundays and have indicated at work, the
        dates we'll have weekend projects. Thankfully, my team are super
        accommodating and will help make this work for me.
