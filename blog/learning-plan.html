          A guided discussion on study goals, personal attributes and how I will

      <h3>28 February 2025</h3>

      <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
      <p>
        Full stack developer. Long term I'd love opportunities to be involved
        with different industries and learn the role software plays in achieving
        their vision. I also admire small business. Down the road, I'd love to
        give back in some way by helping find software solutions that could help
        small businesses succeed.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Give a description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
      </h3>
      <p>Learning strengths:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Happy dancing</strong>. I find problem-solving enjoyable.
          Nothing is better than celebrating after solving what is seemingly
          impossible at the time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>I love a list!</strong> I'm checklist-orientated and find it
          helps with breaking a bigger goal into short-term successes and lets
          you figure out what you need to prioritize.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>I'm a creative thinker</strong>. My work life so far has
          taught me the importance of being innovative. This can be in big and
          small ways but always lead by the same question: is there a way this
          could be done better?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Learning limitations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Oh flip!</strong> I've only had more 'traditional' learning
          experiences up until now and the flipped classroom approach has meant
          forming new habits, moving away from knowledge and answers towards
          thinking critically and seeking solutions. It'll be a journey but it's
          been rewarding so far!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The keyboard</strong>. Like, the literal keys. I'm not the
          quickest at typing out code, I don't know all the shortcuts. But we're
          getting there...slowly.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Self belief</strong>. I find my confidence in one thing is
          often dictated by what's going in the rest of my life - a not so great
          week at work means it might shake my self belief during study.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <h3>
        What non-technical/human skills would you like to see developed in
        yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Collaboration</strong>. In a day job where I have a management
        role, it can feel very singular at times. I'm excited to see what I can
        learn working with others without this dynamic at play and learning from
        those with more background in coding.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Building relationships</strong>. Having been in retail, customer
        service, entertainment industries in the past, I'm looking forward to
        being introduced to, and working with, a new cross-section of people and
        personalities.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Managing uncertainty</strong>. I do OK but want to push myself
        in this regard. In an industry that's forever evolving. I want to
        develop strategies for when I feel 'lost' in learning and better manage
        that feeling of "am I ever going to understand this"?
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Outline your commitment to managing your workload</h3>
      <p>
        I have scheduled my week to include twenty hours of study around work
        and other commitments. I have organized to have Saturdays 'free'. This
        provides a buffer and should anything unexpected come up, there is room
        to be flexible or add in some extra study time.
      </p>
      <p>
        When working with others, I value their time and respect that we are all
        showing up with different things going on in our personal lives. While
        the best way to converse, brainstorm ideas or execute the workload may
        differ among the group, what will be consistent is my level of respect,
        an eagerness to succeed and, importantly, my aim have a great time
        learning to code! Any moments that aren't feeling so great, my
        preference is to talk it through as soon as possible and try find a
        solution. I'll seek advice from people outside a situation when needed
        and if really bothersome, there is the facilitation team to reach out
        to. One-on-one conversations, the discord chat or messages are all tools
        available to use.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I've reached a difficult spot in learning, I will look to previous
        notes or to the internet for some additional resources. Following that,
        I will message my homegroup or the cohort at large to see if anyone else
        is feeling the heat too or has some guidance. If I haven't found a
        solution within 2-3 days, I will reach out to the facilitators.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>What do you expect from the Facilitation team?</h3>
      <p>
        Nothing that hasn't already been demonstrated: a set time to check-in
        regularly with our homegroup, options for conversations throughout the
        week if needed, care for how we're doing and how our lives are outside
        of studying. Moving towards the more intense parts of the course,
        thoughtful feedback, suggestions for moving forward and a positive
        figure to call on for guidance is what I will find most helpful.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>
        What other commitments do you need to consider during the course of your
        studies this year?
      </h3>
      <p>
        We are due to have a family reunion this year across Easter weekend.
        Apart from that, there aren't any commitments I haven't already
        accounted for. I usually work Sundays and have indicated at work, the
        dates we'll have weekend projects. Thankfully, my team are super
        accommodating and will help make this work for me.
