          Better understanding our brain's power to learn and the 'Growth
          Mindset'
        </em>
      </h2>
      <h3>20 March 2025</h3>
      <p>
        Neuroplasticity. The word sounds as if it belongs in a Marvel movie, and
        why not? It's kind of fun to think of it like a real life super power,
        one we can wield in the face of life's challenges. Also, like any good
        blockbuster, there's a leading role - one you get to play while shaping
        your plastic, fantastic brain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Neuroplasticity highlights our brain's ability to change our neural
        pathways, create new connections and organise our brains to better learn
        and behave differently. The research is a convincing case against the
        old understanding that our brain structure is more or less fixed from
        childhood.
      </p>
      <p>
        The biggest benefits to people understanding this, in my opinion, are
        confidence and comfort. The first comes when we realise, while mastering
        a skill seems impossible when starting, the path to learning something
        deeply requires very achievable processes - repetition, reflection for
        example. The second is a more spiritual effect and the reason why
        research also shows that just explaining someone's brain to them in this
        way has an empowering effect, because they realise that intelligence is
        not just a predetermined trait.
      </p>
      <p>
        Understanding neuroplasticity offers the chance to approach this course
        with three goals in mind:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Learning</strong> - improving my understanding with practice,
          review and putting information in a familiar context to create strong
          connections I can more easily relate to.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Personal growth</strong> - connecting what we're learning in
          this course with some other aspect of life that might be relevant or
          of benefit.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Building resilience</strong> - working towards 'practise
          making permanent' for as many skills as possible while understanding
          which exercises offer the most efficient way to achieve this.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>

        from the International Bureau of Education. Half way down, there's an
        outline of some study done on 'Neuroplasticity in Action' and a section
        on the story of Einstein's brain. Both are an easy and worthwhile read.

        This scene from Bridesmaids is not the most academic of clips, but it's
        a funny segway into talking about the 'growth mindset', a concept based
        on what we've discussed so far - that our brain is capable of being
        shaped and changed over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Individuals who believe their talents can be developed through hard
        work, good strategies and input from others, have a growth mindset. I
        have heard this term thrown around before but after some further
        reading, my understanding changed slightly as to why it can be so
        effective. It's not that this mindset is made up of praise and reward
        for your effort alone. It's not that a growth mindset always equals good
        things happening. The value of this approach is how you experience the
        learning journey. Rather than a fixed mindset and viewing your skills as
        innate gifts, you will often achieve more with a growth mindset as you
        are less worried about looking smart and put more energy into learning.
        A comfortability for making mistakes or taking risks that might not work
        out - these are two important traits of a growth mindset I hope to have
        moving forward.

        His writing style is very relatable and he shares good wit and wisdom
        while discussing this topic.

        This all ties in nicely with my overall Learning Plan. Using methods
        that leverage our brain's neuroplasticity give me confidence in being
        able to level up my learning, particularly as we head towards Bootcamp.
        Demonstrating a growth mindset along this journey makes it easier to
        tackle those areas I wanted to work on and will help me keep a healthy
        attitude towards my progress overall.
