      <h1>A Blueprint for Better Wellbeing</h1>

      <h3>21 March 2025</h3>

      <p>
        Developed by Tā Mason Durie in 1984 and based on the four walls of a
        wharenui, the <strong>Te Whare Tapa Whā</strong> model uses four
        dimensions of wellbeing, important to Māori. The wharenui has
        connections to the whenua (land, sea, natural world) which forms the
        foundation of these dimensions. Here is my plan for incorporating these
        hollistic elements as part of my overall learning strategy.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Taha Tirana (Physical Wellbeing)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Gym</strong> - Four times a week. Planned as part of my weekly
          schedule but can switch around days if needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Lake Walks</strong> - At least once a week. I live not far
          from Lake Moananui in Tokoroa. Will walk for an hour when the
          weather's good.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Rest</strong> - Three recovery days per week (from gym)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Taha Whānau (Family Wellbeing)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Dinner with whānau</strong> - Every weekday. Good time to be
          with family and get a break between finishing work and starting study
          in the evenings.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Watching the rugby</strong> - 1-2 days a week. It's something
          we're all interested in so brings us together to eat some food and
          enjoy the game for a couple of hours.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Taha Hinengaro (Emotional and Mental Wellbeing)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Gym</strong> - Four times a week. I find the gym good for my
          mental wellbeing and if I've hit a road block with study, it's a good
          space to problem solve, away from the computer while doing another
          activity.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Crochet</strong> - At least 15 minutes per day. I taught
          myself how to use the hooks last year and because you follow patterns,
          repeat the same stitches, I find it quite meditative, but hard to fit
          in as much as I would like with work and study needing most of my
          time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Journal</strong> - As needed. I keep one next to my bed. I
          don't write every day but if I'm having a rough time, sometimes I find
          journal writing a useful tool.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Meditation </strong> - Daily, during the morning. I've never
          been able to get into meditation but since learning about the UCLA
          health app in Foundations, the five minute Basic Meditation I find
          achievable and helpful.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Taha Wairua (Spiritual Wellbeing)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Book, Podcast, Video</strong> - Once per week. I'll read a
          chapter from a book or watch a clip from Youtube or a podcast that
          touches on some aspect of spiritual wellbeing. I have regulars I like,
          saved on my computer.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Gratitude check</strong> - Five minutes before bed. Take a
          moment to find gratitude for three things that happened during the
          day.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Whenua (Interconnections to the land and environment)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Breaks in the front yard</strong> - 2-3 times a week. When I
          take a ten minute break from study, if the weather is good, I'll go
          stand outside in the sun and take in some fresh air.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Learning in nature</strong> - During study sessions. I'm lucky
          to live out in the country, surrounded by trees and nature. I have my
          door open as much as possible to hear the birds, catch the breeze
          while I'm working.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Lake Walks</strong> - At least once a week. Will walk for an
          hour when the weather's good.
