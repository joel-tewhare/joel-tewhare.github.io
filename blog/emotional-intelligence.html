      <p>
        The title of this post is from one of my favorite poems by Rumi. It came
        to mind at the end of doing some research into emotional intelligence.
        It's been a worthwhile exercise finding write ups and videos that
        discuss this concept. It's something I work on but had never considered
        it from an academic point of view.
      </p>
      <p>
        The biggest benefit I took away was that having great EQ means you're
        able to monitor your own and others emotions, then use what you learn to
        guide your thinking and actions. If we think of IQ as 'what you can do'
        then EQ is 'how you do it'. What's great is emotional intelligence is
        learned and learnable - like a muscle, you can take your EQ to the gym
        and work on it.
      </p>
      <p>Some mental tools of the trade:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Mindfulness</strong> - being able to relate to others, and
          understand ourselves. As a result, we become less reactive in
          challenging situations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Self-mastery</strong> - tuning in to who we are, how we are
          and how we engage in situations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Creating useful mental habits</strong> - developing methods to
          deal with critical thoughts and judgement of yourself and others.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You're a winner when you have the right systems and practices in place
        to work at improving your EQ (think meditation, journal-writing for
        example). Not only are empathy, improved happiness and self-awareness
        nice qualities as a result, they are key contributors towards high
        quality performance, leadership and working at an optimal level.
      </p>
      <p>
        So here's to improving our emotional intelligence along this journey and
        hopefully managing our thoughts and feelings in a productive way moving
        forward - a notion touched on in 'The Guest House' by Rumi. I really
        love this poem, and I love it more read by Helena Bonham Carter - check
        it out.
