      <h3>A simple problem</h3>
      <p>
        This was one of the challenges I decided to finish a night of study with
        during the week.
      </p>

        <em
          >JavaScript Kata, Gradebook Challenge #5: Complete the average
          function that returns the average of a given array of numbers</em
        >
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        After looking online, I found a forEach() method you could use to find
        an average. Using some example code as a guide, I wrote the code
        above...it didn't work! I spent half an hour stumped - I took a 'try
        something' approach and switched different values around to reorder
        them. I tried changing brackets and other parts with no success. Feeling
        confused but not defeated, I took a short break then decided to reset
        everything back to what I had at the start and have another go. It's as
        I was doing this, I saw I had written 'foreach' instead of 'forEach'!
      </p>
      <p>Lessons learned:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Read code carefully (and then read it again)</li>
        <li>Start with the basics when problem solving and go from there</li>
        <li>
          Be mindful that after 10pm, with a couple hours of study on the clock,
          you might not be at your sharpest!
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <h3>An elegant solve</h3>
      <p>
        This challenge was an example of good problem solving and reflection.
        For this particular function, the outline was straightforward so didn't
        need to create pseudocode which was helpful to begin.

      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        This challenge had a couple of methods used previously which I could
        remember the basic function of. This combined with some online research
        gave me the framework to put this code together. During the challenge, I
        kept learning comments underneath as a way of looping back to myself
        what I had done to make different parts work. I felt happy that this
        challenge had a good sense of flow and gave me a deeper understanding of
        new concepts as well as highlighting the actions I had taken to help
        make the tests pass.

      <h3>Reviewing problem solving techniques</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Pseudocode</strong> - definitely appeals to my organized
          brain. Confident for the most part. There's been a couple of times
          when I'm that lost going into a challenge, I can't even form the
          checklist to start solving it!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Trying something</strong> - I'm confident to try things -
          that's why we have command+z (ctrl+z)! I learned to comment out a set
          of code first if I'm trying something completely new - just in case I
          need to go back.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Rubber ducky method</strong> - I haven't really turned to this
          method to problem solve, but I'll often talk back to myself after I've
          solved something, explaining each of the steps I took and why they
          make the function work.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reading error messages</strong> - I grew in confidence and
          understanding of error messages during these JavaScript Kata
          challenges. Having them show (or not) every time you saved your code
          was a good hint many times about how to fix if needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Console.logging</strong> - also got better at this during
          these challenges. It was encouraging when I would console.log
          something halfway through and it showed I was on the right track.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Googling</strong> - I'm confident in researching online and
          I'm becoming familiar with the sites that have helped on multiple
          occasions. Can't not mention the help of ChatGPT as a learning
          assistant too.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Improving your process with reflection</strong> - this is the
          method I've come to use much more during this sprint. For most of the
          challenges I added comments reflecting on how doing the challenge was,
          new things I learned, obstacles I faced etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Asking your peers/coaches for help</strong> - I've only
          reached out on the discord once or twice so far, but I feel confident
          to do so if I'm really stuck and needing support.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When it comes to asking for help in general - when I've felt reluctant
        to, it's usually from assuming what someone's response will be or
        playing out scenarios in my head (judgement, confusion, apathy) that
        ultimately leads to not asking. Realizing that the conversation has just
        as much possibility of going positively is the better mindset to have
        next time I feel this way.
