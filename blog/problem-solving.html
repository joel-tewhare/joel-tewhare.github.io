      <h3>A simple problem</h3>
      <p>
        This was one of the challenges I decided to finish a night of study with
        during the week.
      </p>

        <em
          >JavaScript Kata, Gradebook Challenge #5: Complete the average
          function that returns the average of a given array of numbers</em
        >
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I had researched using Google and found there was a forEach method you
        could use to find an average. Using some example code as a guide, I
        wrote the code above...it didn't work! I spent half an hour stumped -
        first I took a 'try something' approach and switched different values
        around to reorder them. I tried changing names of things ie 'scores'
        instead of 'elements'. When this didn't work I went back to the internet
        to research again. After a short break, I decided to reset everything
        back to what I had at the start and have another go at solving this
        challenge. It's as I was doing this, I saw I had written 'foreach'
        instead of 'forEach'!
      </p>
      <p>Lessons learned:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Read your code carefully</li>
        <li>Start with the basics when problem solving and go from there</li>
        <li>
          Be mindful that after 10pm, with a couple hours of study on the clock,
          you might not be at your sharpest
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <h3>An elegant solve</h3>
      <p>
        This challenge was an example of multiple problem solving techniques
        working nicely together. For this particular function, there was little
        knowledge I had off the top of my head about how to start solving it.

        The first step was writing pseudocode. A couple of challenges prior, I
        switched up the way I wrote these and found it helpful. Framing each
        point "Need a way to" or "Need to find a way to" for example, pointed me
        in a clearer direction when it came to the second problem solving method
        - online research. I found useful web resources through Google, many
        with example code that I could use to tailor my own code. Once I had all
        the parts, it did take some time to figure out how to write all these
        functions together. Despite that, I felt happy that I had created a flow
        for problem solving that made sense to me and was successful in helping
        me pass this particular test with little issue. I also got in the habit
        of adding 'reflection' comments after completing most challenges.

      <h3>Reviewing problem solving techniques</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Pseudocode</strong> - definitely appeals to my organized
          brain. Confident for the most part. There's been a couple of times
          when I'm that lost going into a challenge, I can't even form the
          checklist to start solving it!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Trying something</strong> - I'm confident to try things -
          that's why we have command+z (ctrl+z)! I learned to comment out a set
          of code first if I'm trying something completely new - just in case I
          need to go back.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Rubber ducky method</strong> - I haven't really turned to this
          method to problem solve, but I'll often talk back to myself after I've
          solved something, explaining each of the steps I took and why they
          make the function work.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reading error messages</strong> - I grew in confidence and
          understanding of error messages during these JavaScript Kata
          challenges. Having them show (or not) every time you saved your code
          was a good hint many times about how to fix if needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Console.logging</strong> - also got better at this during
          these challenges. It was encouraging when I would console.log
          something halfway through and it showed I was on the right track.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Googling</strong> - I'm confident in researching online and
          I'm becoming familiar with the sites that have helped on multiple
          occasions. Can't not mention the help of ChatGPT as a learning
          assistant too.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Improving your process with reflection</strong> - this is the
          method I've come to use much more during this sprint. For most of the
          challenges I added comments reflecting on how doing the challenge was,
          new things I learned, obstacles I faced etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Asking your peers/coaches for help</strong> - I've only
          reached out on the discord once or twice so far, but I feel confident
          to do so if I'm really stuck and needing support.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When it comes to asking for help in general - when I've felt reluctant
        to, it's usually from assuming what someone's response will be or
        playing out scenarios in my head (judgement, confusion, apathy) that
        ultimately leads to not asking. Realizing that the conversation has just
        as much possibility of going positively is the better mindset to have
        next time I feel this way.
