          Thoughts on some of the motivations and values I'm bringing to this

        You can picture it, a crossroad you probably find yourself at a lot -
        one road leads down an easier path, but towards a person you don't
        really enjoy being, and a second path that's harder, but leads you to
        act as the kind of person you want to be.
        <strong>The ethical choice is effing hard!</strong> Imagine you're
        hiring some extra help at work for Christmas and your team mate has told
        his daughter to apply. You end up hiring her, instead of someone with
        more experience. This happened to me recently. I had decided to
        prioritize personal ties over merit. I was willing to put more work into
        training and be able to help a friend out.
      </p>
      <p>---</p>

        For me, a high compliment is someone saying I remind them of a person I
        know or admire. It might be that I have generosity like my dad, funny
        like my friend or business savvy like my boss.

          >Truth is, people rub off on us all the time and it's kinda nice to
          think about who has best shaped your identity and values (cue warm
          fuzzies)</strong
        >. I learned the value of community early on with my family, growing up
        in a small town. I think the kitchen table is one of the most important
        pieces of furniture in a home. It's where I've experienced community
        most vividly and is the place many of my values were cemented as a kid
        and continue as an adult - the importance of laughter, caring for
        visitors, accepting a challenging viewpoint, being willing to stand up
        for your own, making a decent cup of tea...as I said, the IMPORTANT
        stuff! More recently, my values have been shaped working nearly ten
        years on cruise ships. Working alongside thirty-plus nationalities,
        surrounded by water, can be both challenging and rewarding. You learn a
        lot about people, everything from how their culture shapes their world
        view to how you both can curve your accents to understand one another.
        You learn the value of creating family when away from your own and most
        importantly, how to work hard, play hard!

        <strong>If I'm honest, I love a good quote</strong>. I can't help it, I
        grew up when the wave of self-help books and spirituality was at its
        gnarliest. A couple come to mind that help my approach to learning and
        highlight some of my strengths:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"I am a human being, nothing human can be alien to me"</em> - if you
        accept this, then you can never look at someone's rude behaviour and say
        'oh I'd never do that...'. On the flip side, if someone does something
        great and seemingly impossible, you take comfort in the fact that you
        have everything in you, just as they do, to be able to achieve the same
        things. I try to keep a positive outlook like this which puts me in a
        helpful position to learn.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"Life is long, if you're lucky"</em> - Essentially, don't sweat the
        small stuff. I keep a big picture view to get through the challenges of
        the day. Chances are you'll look back after a day, month, year and
        wonder what the fuss was all about. Be grateful for what you're
        problem-solving and learning today, tomorrow isn't a guarantee.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"You can have it all, you just can't have it all at once"</em> -
        Have patience. Success requires all kinds of sacrifice with failure
        pretty much built into the process when you choose to dream big. I'm
        less shaken by making mistakes with this mindset and try my best to see
        success possible for anything you're willing to stick with.
      </p>
      <p>---</p>
      <p>
        Waxing poetic about myself is good and all but
        <strong>we all have our limits day-to-day</strong>. Sometimes you don't
        think you can achieve anything great. Sometimes you are sweating the
        small stuff. Sometimes you are impatient for success. There's outside
        influences that can hinder progress - a massive day at work before an
        evening of study, a busy household you're trying to study in the middle
        of, the blue sky of summer tempting you away from the computer screen.
        These things can pull focus and steer you off your learning journey.
        Then there's technical limitations. Sure, we all have to start
        somewhere, but learning new programs or how to use your computer for
        coding is daunting when starting out. It's important to recognize
        because it likely means you may move ahead slower than you'd like at
        times.
      </p>
      <p>---</p>

        As anyone who has worked in a team will tell you, nothing is more
        challenging than struggling through a brainstorming session in silence.
        You're trying to be productive but no one wants to speak, contribute or
        even smile. I've overcome this scenario by splitting people off into
        pairs and having them write ideas down which I then read out once the
        whole group reassembled. I have seen people successfully add an element
        of fun into this 'boring' activity like adding a quiz at the top of the
        session, having music on for ten minutes in the background before
        starting. <strong>Working with others requires trust</strong>. These
        kinds of options are available when facing resistance working
        individually with someone - if possible, work for a period alone and
        then come together to discuss, don't jump into work straight away and
        chat about life for ten minutes. Anyway you can relax people's egos or
        remove the sense of judgement in the room, you should be open to trying.
