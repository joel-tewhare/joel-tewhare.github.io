        where colour blind family members are given special glasses that let
        them see colour for the first time? This is what it's like introducing
        JavaScript to your HTML and CSS when programming - no, not because it
        makes you ugly cry (though, based on how challenging this sprint was at
        times...maybe?) but because it helps you see the web landscape in a new,
        exciting way. In simple terms, HTML helps give structure to your
        document and CSS offers styling. Javascript works with both of these
        building blocks, using its own language to give life to these elements.
        Much is commonplace today - the way things move around your screen in an
        interesting way or a specific action that follows a mouse click are two
        popular examples of JavaScript at work. It started as a programming
        language to help make web pages more interactive, but as technology
        grows, you can find it used in many devices including phones and tablets
        and other applications such as robotics.

        By default, the code we write for JavaScript is executed from top to
        bottom. However, some of the magic users experience when on webpages or
        apps is helped largely by 'Control Flow' which allows settings to differ
        about what code is executed and when. There are certain conditional
        (true/false) statements and 'loops' available that make this possible
        and show off the flexibility and dynamic power of JS. We spent a good
        amount of time this sprint working on loops which allow us to circle
        back over a particular set of tasks to either perform an action
        repeatedly or compile a list of data. Imagine you kept an empty list on
        your fridge and every time you opened it for food during the week, you
        wrote down anything you were out of. Come the end of the week, you had a
        shopping list ready and didn't have to sit and remember everything to
        buy...this is what we hope to achieve with loops - performing a
        repetitive task with less work.
