        <em> Reflection Q + A on Human Skills during Foundations </em>
      </h2>
      <h3>9 April 2025</h3>

      <h3>
        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
        due to the Human Skills learning?
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I thought I'd have an issue with not being able to learn everything to
          do with a topic or have a good grasp of it at least. Learning more
          about flipped learning, a 'not yet' attitude and a focus on
          problem-solving has gone a long way towards making me more comfortable
          with uncertainty and tools to move through it.
        </li>
        <li>
          I learned to not count yourself out. For me, there was a moment when I
          thought coming into study again at a later age meant I'd have to work
          harder in some capacity. I've realized we all can name a
          'disadvantage' we think we have if we try hard enough. I've
          appreciated reading up on things like neuroplasticity and emotional
          intelligence. They show that a) there's scientific proof that our
          brains are capable of learning throughout our lifetime and b) there's
          an important place for learning that's both academic and EQ-related.
        </li>
        <li>
          All this work we have done with Human Skills to help tackle software
          development has naturally had an impact on other parts of my life. An
          example is Listening and Looping and how I'll try be a mindful
          listener with work mates or family (not interrupting, relaying parts
          back in the conversation). Surprised I've been able to improve these
          skills in what I assumed was going to be a mostly 'technical' learning
          experience.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <h3>
        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
        programming?
      </h3>
      <p>
        In terms of values, I think having to identify your own, means you also
        consider lesser important values to you and acknowledge in the process
        that other people may place those higher on their list. This then leads
        you down a road of more empathy towards others, particularly the ability
        to be flexible (or understanding at least) when working with others and
        their particular style of communication or carrying out tasks.
        Programming requires working on such large projects a lot of the time,
        that you probably can't escape the need to keep this kind of mindset to
        be able to work with people successfully. Self-awareness means you have
        your own values at the forefront of your mind to guide your actions and
        helps keep you in check in instances where you feel you might be
        straying from effectively learning or completing a coding exercise.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</h3>
      <p>
        The emphasis placed on these skills within the course as a whole so far.
        I've also enjoyed reviewing and reflecting on the topics in my own words
        in our blog posts, after learning about them.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>
        What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Being diligent about the topics and really thinking about them as
          practical tools and less as soft, 'kumbaya' concepts.
        </li>
        <li>
          At times, keeping yourself honest and relating the topics to yourself
          as objectively as possible, rather than coming up with what you think
          makes you look good.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <h3>
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I think you've probably seen a number of examples where the highest
        technical abilities aren't enough to see a programmer truly succeed
        without a balance of good human skills alongside them to use. It also
        seems that technical abilities are not the entire skill base that most
        employers are looking for.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>
        Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a
        waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise
        programming instead? Justify your answer.
      </h3>
      <p>
        I would've argued yes in the beginning weeks of this course. As someone
        coming into this with no prior coding experience, I was keen to start
        learning as much of the technical concepts as possible. As we've
        progressed, I see the benefit of it more and more. As challenges have
        grown in difficulty, there's been an increased need for tools to help
        with problem-solving, minding your personal wellbeing and encouraging
        yourself to not give up.
